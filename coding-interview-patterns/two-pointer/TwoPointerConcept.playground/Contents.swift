/**
 Two-pointer
 It is a powerful technique often used in solving array and linked list problems. It involves manipulating two pointers (or indices) in some fashionâ€”either moving towards each other, or one pointer leading/following the other.

 Key Patterns
 - Two pointers moving towards each other: Often used to solve problems like checking palindromes or finding pairs that sum up to a target.
 - Two pointers moving in the same direction: One pointer might move faster than the other, such as in problems that involve detecting cycles or finding the middle of a list.
